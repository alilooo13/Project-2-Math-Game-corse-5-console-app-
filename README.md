🧮 Math Quiz Console Game (C++)

An interactive Math Quiz Game built in C++ that dynamically generates arithmetic questions, evaluates user answers, tracks scores, and provides real-time feedback.
This project was designed to strengthen core C++ fundamentals through a practical, game-based application.

📌 Project Overview

The Math Quiz Game allows the user to:

Select difficulty levels and operation types

Answer randomly generated math questions

Receive instant feedback on answers

Track correct and incorrect responses

Replay the quiz multiple times in one session

The project simulates a small educational game with basic AI-driven question generation and structured game flow.
